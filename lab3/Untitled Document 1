- if the robot has more joints than the task space dimensions, then the robot is kinematically redundant, we can take advantage of this to perform more dextereuos movements while developing a task. Another advantage of having a redundant robot is, in the case of a joint mallfunciton, the robot may still be able to complete the task.

- To compute the

- The null space of the jacobian represents all the joint velocities that dont affect the currect task of the jacobian 
	mathecmatically speaking this means that the null space of the jacobian is the set of velocities that satisfy :
	J*dq = 0   meaning that when applying that dq (joint velocity) the velocity in the end effector will be cero. 

	P is the projectior of the null space. If the system is redundant will be different than 0
	P = I - J^-1 @ J
